<h1>PROBLEM1(CCCB01) </h1>
<p>Golu has a set of numbers and has recently studied set theory. He has created a power set of this set and is writing a program to compute sum of all elements of all the subsets in power set. 
Power set of a set S is defined as set of all possible subsets of S.

Set S consist of all the number from 1 to N.

You need to calculate this sum for a given n.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line has T, the total number of test cases.
The next T lines contains a number N in each line.</p>
<p>Sample Input:1 3</p>
<p>Sample Output :24</p>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>T lines giving answer as defined in the question for each N.</p>


<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1<=T<=42 <br>
1<=N<=42</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Given N=3,
S={1,2,3}
P(S) = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}
answer = (1)+(2)+(3)+(1+2)+(1+3)+(2+3)+(1+2+3)
= 24</b>.
